  <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
  <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
    Chemical Elements</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.ptable.com/" target="_blank"><u>periodic table</u></a> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron. H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
  <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
  <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical reactions</i>
  </p>
  <p>2H2+O2H₂O</p>
  <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H₂)</i> and oxygen gas <i>(O2)</i> to form water <i>(H₂O)</i>.</p>
  <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
  <p> <var>Stoichiometry</var> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
  <p> <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion</p>
  <h5>Conclusion</h5>
  <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
